The existence of prehistoric culture in Kanniyakumari District is evident from the discovery of Neolithic Celt which may roughly be dated to 1500 to 1000 B.C. A handmade coarse earthen jar and other relics were found near Thoothur Village in Kanniyakumari District. The shape, fabric and the decorations indicate that they are probably of the megalithic or early historic period. From the legends and traditions existing in these regions, it has to be believed, beyond doubt, that a great city flourished in these regions during the megalithic or early historic period and that it might have been similar to the one which existed in Mohanjadaro and Harappa. Since, the relics of this period remained in the sea bed, it has to be believed that this civilization was wiped out due to sea erosion </p>
